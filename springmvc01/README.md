# Simple Spring MVC Application with REST Service implementation

This is a simple spring mvc project to show spring mvc implementation.
Also it shows the the Spring mvc REST implementation.

Run this project as below,

	mvn clean install
        
        install the war file to a web container such as tomcat

  	you can see your application working in /springmvc01


Thank you.
